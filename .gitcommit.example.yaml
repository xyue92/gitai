# Custom commit guidelines (IMPORTANT - Company/Team Standards)
# Paste your company's commit message requirements here
# The AI will follow these guidelines strictly when generating commits
#
# Examples of what you can put here:

# - Mandatory fields (ticket numbers, reviewers, etc.)
# - Naming conventions
# - Special requirements (emojis, prefixes, etc.)
#
custom_prompt: |
  Follow our team's commit message guidelines:
  - Use imperative mood (e.g., "add" not "added")
  - Focus on the "why" and business impact, not the "how"
  - Keep subject line under 72 characters
  - Use present tense

  # Example: If your company requires ticket numbers, add:
  # - Include Jira ticket number: [PROJ-123]
  # - Format: <type>(<scope>): [TICKET] <description>

  # Example: If your company uses specific prefixes:
  # - Backend changes must use prefix: [BE]
  # - Frontend changes must use prefix: [FE]

  # Example: If your company requires specific sections:
  # - Must include "Business Impact:" section
  # - Must include "Testing:" section with test coverage info
