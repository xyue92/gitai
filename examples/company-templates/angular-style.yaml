  - ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
  - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
  - revert: Reverts a previous commit

  - Don't capitalize first letter
  - No dot (.) at the end
  - Max 50 characters

  EXAMPLE:
  feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays

  The parser can now handle array syntax in configuration files.
  This enables users to define multiple values for a single key.

  Previous behavior required separate keys for each value, which
  was verbose and error-prone.

  Closes #456
  BREAKING CHANGE: Array syntax changes the configuration format
